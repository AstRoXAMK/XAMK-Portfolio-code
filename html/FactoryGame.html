                    A mobile game meant to be enjoyed on the go and at home as well
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A part tower defense part base building game. The main game would 
                    take place in the base of the user and the missions would have been a 
                    tower defense mission to collect the resources needed to build the base.

                    Progress
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The game, at the time of leaving, was in a state that it would have been
                    at the stage to start devloping the tower defense and base building phase.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I had worked on the UI for the most part of my time and was starting to 
                    work on the building aspect of the game.

                    <br>
                    The game is being worked on by another programmer as of 18.1.2023

                <p>
                    Well the biggest problems I had while working on the project happened 
                    to mostly be the fact that I was working alone. I had no real experience working
                    on unity, but I was able to make use of vidoes found on YouTube to create something 
                    that, while no proud of, was still satisfied with the outcome.

            <div class="section sec5" id="conclusion">    
                <h3>
                    Conclusion
                </h3>
                <p>
                    While I may have not worked on the project for a long time, I was still able to learn something
                    about Unity as well as my passions. In the future I will be working on projects that I, 
                    not only find to be more interesting than a mobile game, but also projects that I enjoy 
                    working on. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I will also be working with a bigger team than me, myself and I, to divide the work and work more 
                    efficiently

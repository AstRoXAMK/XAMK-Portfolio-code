                        Astro JS is a new JavaScript framework which whole 
                        stitch is the use or lack there of JavaScript.
                        When I first dove into JavaScript, it was a whole lot of speghetti 
                        that I did not really like to work in.
                        That is not to say that you cannot use JavaScript, in fact
                        the framework allows the creators to add their favourite JS Frameworks
                        into the project.

                    <p>
                        Note: Of course the framework does not support every single
                        JS Framework but for the most part it does allow for the 
                        most used Frameworks to exist. Such as ReactJS, VueJS, Solid.JS and Svelte.

                            Astro JS also allows for support on Tailwind CSS for responsive

                            The background is a gradient from a darker cyan colour
                            to a darker purple and this colour scheme will be used
                            for the rest of the pages as well

                            The titles use a variation of purple and cyan

                    <p class="overall-text">
                        The layouts for the pages utilize a BaseLayout component that 
                        contains the footer, contacts and the navigation bar. The head 
                        tag for the page is also found in the BaseLayout component.

                        The pages themselves mostly consists from preview components that
                        show cards with most of them containing a link to a page that renders
                        a markdown file. The markdown file is then rendered into HTML and then
                        displayed on the page.

                                I utilized Astro JS components for the footer and nav bar, but 
                                the navbar still requires some work to be done. I also used 
                                Typed.js for the text under my name for extra effect.
                            </p>

                                For the about page I used a component named AboutMePreview.
                                This component will be talked about later. Essentially it maps a folder
                                full of markdown files and then renders a fraction of the file into a card.
                                This page contains information about my education and other work 
                                related courses and certificates. The about page is also capable of
                                setting the different parts in order of date.
                            </p>

                                Image of the finished page:

                                The Projects page utilizes the same component as the About page, with 
                                a different name, because in order to use the same component for different
                                purposes, I had to render the folders in different components so that
                                the pages would render the correct contents. This page contains a list of
                                my main projects that I have worked on. The projects are ordered from the
                                start date so, the newest projects are at the top.

                                I have yet to write any real articles, but I still find the page
                                to be useful for testing and when I eventually do write articles.
                                The current articles are just placeholders for when I actually
                                decide to write articles.

                                This is the last page on my website. It is very simple.
                                It also does not need to be very complicated as the main
                                contact form is in a component that is used on every page.
                                The contacts are the same as the XAMK portfolio one as I 
                                do not see a reason to change it.

                                    exists a premade astro component navbar, but I find it better to just
                                    use my own. There is also a mobile navbar for mobile use.

                                    These components are so miniscule in the grand scheme of things that 
                                    I did not want to write about them individually. These include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            CV_Download button

                                    They do exactly what you would expect them to do.

                <div>
                    <h4>Landing page</h4>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        While the landing page is simple, I had some trouble with it. 
                        First of all the Typed.js part text does not change size via Tailwind CSS
                        but instead a <<code>style</code>> tag had to be used to adjust the sizing.
                        The Typed.js also uses a JavaScript code that determines my current grade 
                        at XAMK and is automated to be working as the years go by.
                    </p>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        Overall Tailwind is convenient for most of the styling but requires
                        the use of <<code>style</code>> tag for miniscule workarounds and 
                        feels a lot simpler that the use of pure CSS or SCSS as I have been using
                        for the most part.
                    </p>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        I decided to make some changes to the landing page. Over the next couple 
                        of hours I changed the outlook, the font and other things in my portfolio.
                        This includes the change in font, background colour and the overall look of the
                        page became much more appealing.

                <div>
                    <h4>Projects page</h4>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        For most of my examples and tutorials I used this 
                        <a href="https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/astro/tree/latest/examples/portfolio?file=src%2Fcontent%2Fwork%2Fbloom-box.md">
                            StackBlitz page
                        </a> 
                        containing a pre-built astro portfolio. I did not directly use it for everything, but used it
                        as an example of how make an astro portfolio.
                    </p>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        The problems with the projects page are minimal. The only thing that I can think of is that
                        the grid was a bit difficult to work with at first. Using the grid component and learning
                        from how to make them in the future was a bit of a hassle. Using the afore mentioned StackBlitz
                        page, I was able to create grid I used for all the pages.
                    </p>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        The best thing that I learned from working in the projects page was the use of a <br>
                        <code>[...slug].astro</code>-element that allows for the rendering of markdown files. 
                        I based the rest of my other pages on this slug element.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>About page</h4>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        The about page follows a similar structure to the projects page. The problematic part begins 
                        when I wanted to create the about page in the same style as the projects page. I had never
                        before workied with markdown files and had to learn how to render them into HTML correctly 
                        and in the intended way. Since some of the elements in the about page were not meant to be
                        markdown files, I did not want them to be links to a markdown file. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        To change this the about page has a conditional operator that checks if the markdown file
                        has a link or not. The ones with a link direct to the rendered markdown file and the ones
                        that do not have a link do not do anything. To separate the working life and educational 
                        lives, I simply just it so that the about page is split between school and work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        The about page was the first where I tried to use the slug element in a different way compared
                        to the projects page and since I do not have that much experience in JavaScript, I spent a 
                        good chunck of time messing with it. Finally after a long time I was able to get it to work.

                    <h4>Articles page</h4>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        As mentioned in the previous section, I have yet to write any articles. Moreover it currently
                        works as a test page for when I inevidably return to edit the portfolio and add articles.

                <div>
                    <h4>Contact Component</h4>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        The contact component is extremely simple in the sense that it really only holds a download
                        link to my Cv and a mail link that auto-fills (hopefully) the senders receiver box with my
                        e-mail. There really weren't any big problems. I just wasn't initially sure how often I 
                        would like for it to be present. I decided that it can be a part of every page and just simply
                        implemented it to the baseLayout.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Preview Components</h4>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        This is where the problems begin. The first part, when I created the projects page, wasn't that bad,
                        since I utilized the StackBlitz page. The problems began when I wanted to create the about page and 
                        modify the data receival from the markdown files in a different folder. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        The next part of the preview components was to work on the different types of files that I wanted to use
                        different markdown files for all different pages, but I had to make different folders for all since, 
                        if I had them in the same folder, it would be rendered on every page. Next was the use of the <br> 
                        <code>[...slug].astro</code>-element. I had to copy and paste the slug element multiple times, as the
                        pages use a different data resource in the slug element.

                    <h4>Grid Component</h4>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        The grid Component was mostly the only component that I copied line for line, for the most part.
                        At first I had no idea on how the grid worked, since the grid would look different on every page.
                        Then I just created the Grid component from scratch and modified the variants to fit my vision.

                    <h4>Navigation Components</h4>
                    <p class="problem-text">
                        The biggest problem with the navigation bar was the implementation of the mobile navigation bar.
                        The normal ways of transferring to a mobile view did not work as the navbars background was not 
                        responsive enough to the point that I fixed it by adding a st amount of pixels for the background 
                        from the top of the screen.

                            <p class="problem-text">
                                The hero component is named similarly to how the first part of the page is named in other JS 
                                frameworks. It represents the top of the page and is the first thing that people read. In my
                                case it also hold the Search-Engine Optimization (SEO) for my portfolio. This component didn't 
                                really pose any problems.

                                The bottom part of the page. It is also the last thing that people see. I made it as one of the first
                                components as it was the easiest to implement into the page. The biggest problem with it was the 
                                transfer to a mobile view. As the footer is really wide, I decided to make the footer divide into
                                two parts that are on top of each other in the mobile view. Other than that it did not pose any problems.

                <p class="conclusion-text">
                    The project was a good introduction to Astro JS. I feel the project will 
                    help me get more accustomed to other front-end JS frameworks. Since I have an interest in 
                    working on full-stack development in the future, I feel that this project was a good start.
                </p>
                <p class="conclusion-text">
                    The project was sufficiently difficult and I feel that I learned a lot from it. Of course things did
                    not go perfectly so, in the future I will plan my websites better and take more time just understanding
                    JavaScript as a coding language, even if I don't like the language.

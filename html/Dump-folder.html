                                A simple password generator that takes 4 values to 
                                create a file that contains the passwords.
                                <br>
                                In the app you can decide:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The amount of paswords that you wish to create
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The lenght of the passwords
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Does the user wish to use numbers
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Does the user wish to use special symbols
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                All of the passwords are the put into a file
                                that can be located in the same file folder as the 
                                program itself. I have yet to fix this part.

                                I got the idea for this password generator as I was working on the
                                Python course provided Helsinki University. I wanted to make it into
                                an app, so I did. I used tKinter library from python for the UI
                                and made it look as simple and easy-to-use as possible.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I did not remember how to use tKinter as it 
                                had been over a year since I last worked on it.
                                I watched a part of the tKinter tutorial provided
                                by FreeCodeCamp and I was already on my way. 
                                I also had problems creating the file for the saved passwords,
                                but I am going to fix this issue once I find out how.

                                A personal game version of tetris. I have plans to use this game file for future ML/AI projects
                                of creating bots that can continuesly get better as the game continues.

                                I got the Idea from watchin PyGame tutorials and I also saw a deep learning video of
                                bots for the game "Jump King". The video creator made his own version of Jump King in JavaScript
                                so I am hoping to be able to do the same for Tetris.

                                I originally worked on this web browser using
                                PyQt5 but decided to switch over to PySide6 as it is a
                                newer and more supported version of the Qt module.

                                Features the web browser will have:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                This web browser is still a work in progress and therefore
                                will not have all the bells and whistles that one might
                                wish to have in their modern browser

                                I had never worked with Qt in any way shape or form
                                and therefore I am a beginner at using it. I have however
                                found that Qt does have dedicated websites and is a very versatile
                                UI creation tool for many different languages

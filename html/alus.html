        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          An endless runner game. Goal of the game is to get as far as possible.
          Avoid the objects and the authorities.
          <br />
          <br />
          A flappy bird and Jetpack Joyride inspired game, with an added
          function of shooting.

        <h3>Progress</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            The work started by making a Unity project as all other light weight
            work starts with. First of it was important to have a player that
            can be used as a placeholder for the main sprite. Making all
            placeholder sprites for the game took no time to make as they would
            be replaced in no time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the placeholders were made, it was time to start working on
            the actual game. Started by making the main scripts
            (Playercontroller, enemy, and object movement) scripts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work on the player script started off by making the player move and
            creating a "switch" -type control so that the player would change
            the direction of the movement by pressing a button. This is the main
            way of movement in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I started the work on projectile scripts. Intantiate
            from the tip of the character and destroy it after a certain amount
            of time to avoid overloading the game. With that, the enemy script
            was the next thing I tackeled. Making the projectile and enemy
            destroy each other simultaneously was the point. The obstacle
            instead would only destroy the projectile if hit.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the main players out of the way, it wastime to look into the
            barriers on the top and the bottom of the screen. Making the
            polarity switch at the same time as the movement of the player, was
            the main point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the game was running well. The next stop would be the to
            implement the score functions to keep track of how far a player was
            able to go and to increase the difficulty of the game as it
            progressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point the game was in its final stretch so I made the
            executive decision to make the game a Web and a mobile versions of
            the game. This was a good decision as the game would be a good game
            for PC and Mobile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding the sounds and music to the game was quite simple thanks to
            an easy to follow tutorial by Brackey. No problems here.
          </p>
          <p>And with that the game was complete.</p>

        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Here's the part what I dreaded the most. All of the problems that I
            encountered on my journey:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>The movement switch:</span> I had already an idea for how
              this could be accomplished with a boolean value, but because of my
              lack of Unity programming I didn't think of using a <br /><code
                >if(!insert boolean value)</code
              >
              if -function. This worked well.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Random spawn location:</span> While finding the spawn
              locations for all the enemies/objects was a simple task, making
              the random spawn location took a bit of time. Using a
              <code>vector<></code> type list, I was able to take the spawn
              locations of all initiated game objects and then using a <br />
              <code>for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++)</code> code line to pick any
              integer between 0 and 3 to instantiate the enemy onto.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Score manager:</span> I am not proud of this one, but the
              lack of UI programming on Unity really showed here. One stupid
              line of code broke the entire scoring system... that's all it
              took.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Player/enemy/obstacle speed-up:</span> This one was a bit
              different. Making a working function and then applying it to all
              of the game objects mentioned. This resulted in confusion and
              making it work properly took quite a while.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Switching from PC only to Mobile:</span> This is probably
              the biggest notable problem I faced. Due to how I had written the
              movement function, it messed with the touch controls for the game.
              I had to remake the whole movement part of my original script to
              accommodate the touch control scripts as well. The switch did not
              go very smoothly at first, but after I had identified what was
              actually happening, I just toughed my way through it. I managed to
              make great controls for both the PC and Mobile versions, which I
              will happily use in other games.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>GitHub:</span> Now by far the biggest cause of hair loss
              during this project. The version contorl. Not only was the making
              of a GitHub repository a pain in the ***, but then keeping it
              updated resulted in other stupid problems. Mainly the fact that
              the repo had successfully messed up the backgroung. Other
              teammembers were unable to use the version I had made due to this
              problem and they had no better way to fix it, other than making a
              new repository. This was infuriating at the time, but quite
              comical looking back at it now.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The project ended with a(n almost) finished project. On my part the
          game was ready to be shipped. But now that I have heard feedback from
          my peers, I will tune the game a little bit to have the game be fully
          ready. The changes will be logged onto here.

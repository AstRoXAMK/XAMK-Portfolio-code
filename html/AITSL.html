                    I was introduced to this book via this 
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/yNYflGw6kJI?si=oQSeO1mQKSQrfVWi" target="_blank">

                    </a>.
                    I was working on Helsinki University MOOC-course "Data Analysis with Python", which I will
                    work on along side this book. I found this book by sheer coincidence

                <br>
                <p>
                    This book was created by 5 different professors from 3 different universities in the USA.
                    Most notably 3 professors from Stamford University, Prof. Trevor Hastie, Prof. Rob Tibshirani and
                    Prof. Jonathan Taylor all of whom are professors of Statistics. Other co-authors are 
                    Prof. Gareth James of Emory University, Goizueta Business School and Prof. Daniela Witten of the University of Washington also 
                    professor of Statistics.

                    Quote from the website: <br>
                    "As the scale and scope of data collection continue to 
                    increase across virtually all fields, statistical learning 
                    has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand 
                    data. An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides a broad and 
                    less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. This 
                    book is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use contemporary tools 
                    for data analysis.

                    The first edition of this book, with applications in R (ISLR), was 
                    released in 2013. A 2nd Edition of ISLR was published in 2021. It 
                    has been translated into Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, 
                    Mongolian, Russian, and Vietnamese. The Python edition (ISLP) was published in 2023.

                            To get started with anything to do with data analysis, ML and AI, you need to download and 
                            install Python and Anaconda navigator. This is the hub that manages everything to do with
                            Data. Then the next step is to download and install the ISLP learning package from 
                            <a href="https://intro-stat-learning.github.io/ISLP/installation.html">this link</a>.

                        <p>
                            The first chapter is an introduction chapter to the book. It goes over the basics and the
                            history of statitical learning. It also has a chapter for people who the book is towards. This 
                            includes: Data scientists, engineers, data analysts and quants along side of other 
                            non-quantitative fields such as social sciences and business. The book is very theoretical 
                            and uses a lot of mathematical formulas. The structure of formulas and matrices is depicled 
                            and documented in this chapter as well.

                        <p>
                            This chapter goes over what statistical learing is, why it is used and how it is used as well as 
                            what difference is between supervised and unsupervised learning. In this chapter we are also 
                            introduced to the first terms and equations that are used in the book. The most prominent 
                            equation introduced in this chapter is KNN (K-nearest neighbours). KNN classifies the 
                            new data points based on the similarity measure of the earlier stored data points.

                            This chapter is also the first chapter that has a Lab section. In these Lab sessions
                            we go over the most prominent libraries and packages that are used in Python. This includes:
                            Pandas, Numpy, Seaborne and Matplotlib. These libraries are considered the most important Python
                            libraries for data analysis, data visualization and even in AI and ML. The labs use a 
                            Jupyter notebook as the base and I intend to use Jupyter notebook as well for the exercises.

                        <p>
                            This chapter is about linear regression, a very simple approach for supervised 
                            learning. In particular, linear regression is a useful tool for predicting
                            a quantitative response. The chapter then also goes over some of the equations
                            to use for linear regression and the two different types of linear regression:
                            Simple- and Multiple linear regression. Two of the more important equations from 
                            this chapter are the Residual Standard Error (RSE) and the R-squared statistic. Also an
                            applicaiton of KNN (chapter 2) and Linear Regression is shown in this chapter.

                    In the ISPL learning package there is also a function call that allows for students to 
                    learn what a certain function does. This is called via library.function? (e.g. numpy.array?) like so:

                    In the exercises section there are Conceptual and Applied exercises. The conceptual exercises
                    are theoretical with the answers found in the book and the applied exercises are practical
                    exercises that use Python and the provided data sets to solve the exercises. Here is an example:

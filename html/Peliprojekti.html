                    FullStack open is an open university course provided by the computer
                    science department from the university of Helsinki. It has gained global 
                    noteriety thanks to its high level of education as well as it has an 
                    active comunity of people in their personal discord server.
                    <br><br>
                    The introduction to python programming course is a replacement course which I decided
                    was a more impotant course for me to undertake in stead of Full Stack Open. I have some experience
                    in Python programming prior to the course, but its parts are divided into 2 parts, beginner and Advanced.
                    I would take both of these parts, but would go through the beginner part in a faster pace,
                    and mostly do the more demanding exercises.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Full Stack open is divided into 14 parts (0-14) from which parts 0-8 and 13 are written
                    by Matti Luukainen, a professor in the computer science department of University of
                    Helsinki (abbr. HU). The rest of the exercises are created by outside contributors, 
                    which include but are not limited to; Terveystalo, 
                    <a href="https://www.smartly.io/?hsLang=en" target="_blank">Smartly.io</a>

                    The introduction to python programming and the advanced python progamming courses are
                    a part of the Computer science department of the University of Helsinki. Each of the parts
                    are worth 5 ETC's. The course also consists of 14 different parts. If you are able to complete 
                    25% of exercises in a part (number of, varies), you can move on to the next part. Parts 1-4 I decided
                    to do exercises that I deemed fun and challenging, while ignoring things I already knew and could solve
                    in my head.

                            The first part of Full stack open was an introductory part with a preference to get the students up to pace.
                            The first problems were a simple way to to get the students accustomed to the course.
                            <br><br>

                        <p>
                            After completing the first part of Full stack open, logially
                            comes part 2. This is the part where I was starting to be behind my own 
                            schedule and already had my thoughts on leaving this course and 
                            focusing more on something that should be better for me in the long term.
                            So, I dropped the course here.
                            <br><br>
                            Part 2 consists of:

                            Part 2 of the Python Programming course is more of the same in part 1.
                            <br><br>
                            Part 2 consists of:

                                <li>More Conditionals</li>
                                <li>Combining conditions</li>
                                <li>Simple loops</li>

                            Third part begins to have some more fun exercises that take more than 5 minutes to crack.
                            Though there is one part that I would not consider to be of high importance; 
                            Working with strings.
                            <br><br>
                            Part 3 consists of:

                            In this part we (have to) make a switch to VS Code for future exercises.
                            This is a good way to get new programmers accustomed to the standard IDE that is
                            the most popular among coders. We also install an Extention by the name of "TestMyCode".
                            This is an Extention made by Helsinki University and it supports (most) MOOC courses
                            provided by HU and other universities as well.

                        <p>
                            This part of the course consists mainly of ways to store data to different types of arrays.
                            There are a couple ways to store data with python (without counting different libraries) 
                            and two of the most important ways are lists (<code>SYNTAX: []</code>) and dictionaries (<code>SYNTAX: {}</code>).
                            While lists are more versatile in storing single type data, disctionaries are able to store 
                            objects. Lists on the other hand are more useful in mathematics with Python.
                            <br><br>

                            Part 6 is mostly about file reading and file manipulation via coding. This is, 
                            for the most part, essential in a lot of different types of fields that deal with important data, 
                            such as <span>Artificial Intelligence</span>, <span>Data Science/Analysis</span>, <span>Cyber Security</span>
                            and <span>Backend/Web Development</span>. The last part can also be considered important as you will learn
                            to create errors in your code that normal people will be able to understand.

                            Final part of the beginner course. This part contains a part that is massive when talking about
                            Python programming in general, modules (or libraries, depending on the person). Since Python is an
                            <code>open-source</code> programming language (different people are able to modify or add to the original
                            source code) there is a plethora of different libraries for different purposes. Some of these include,
                            <code>random</code>, <code>Time</code> and <code>dateTime</code> as well as powerful data processing 
                            libraries such as <code>NumPy</code> and <code>Pandas</code>.

                        <p>Here are my thought on the beginner course of Python programming: </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The course is easy for anyone that that has a little bit of programming experience. As for a total newbie, 
                            the course has a great learning curve that is accustomed to higher education students as well as anyone who 
                            might be interested in becoming a python programmer. The course opens the door and it's upto the student to
                            use this knowledge for future endeavours. TestMyCode (TMC extention on VS code) is also a forgiving automated
                            code testing environment. Students are quickly taught about the most powerful and versatile IDE there is and 
                            they are (kind of) forced into getting used to it. After a while of using VS Code, I can say that, it is still my
                            favourite coding environment.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            While there are a lot of positives, there are also some negatives. Most of it comes in the form of
                            not providing almost any information about professionals paths or professional habits. Biggest of these 
                            is the lack of debugging methods mentioned. Yes, there is indeed a built-in debugger in (from what I know of) 
                            all IDE's on the market. But, there is only a single mention of the word <span>Google</span> in all 7 parts. 
                            any decent coder knows that google is the ultimate debugging tool for solving problems and this might be common sense
                            to an experienced coder, but not for someone who's coded for approximately 7 weeks, at the end of the course. 
                            Googling is a skill that needs to be taught in order for students to be efficient in it.
